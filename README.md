My name is Arvid Holm and I am currently studying IT (second out of five years) at KTH. I first 
started programming during gymnasiet (Swedish equivalent of high school) and I have been interested
ever since. Right now I am working in a store as an extra job a few weekends every month in addition
to my studies.

Currently I am learning to use Unix/Linux systems, more specifically the different terminal commands, 
using MAN pages and also writing shell scripts.
